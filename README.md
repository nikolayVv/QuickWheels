# Quick Wheels

Quick Wheels is an application in Java, which allows the administrators of all types of delivery companies to calculate the optimal delivery route fpr a set of orders in a certain time based on various criterias - type of order, traffic, location of the customer, location of the provider, and type of transport. To implement all that, the application uses two microservices - for orders and for deliveries, each of which has its own API and database. These microservices interact with each other and with the external microservice "Amazon Location Service" to allow the user easy access to all the functionalities.
